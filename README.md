# Human Centered Design for Shared Services

## Project Description
Through this project, we will explore the types of human centered design resources that might benefit government teams tasked with developing centralized administrative and IT services for their agencies.

### Why this project?
18F has handled numerous [path analysis engagments](https://18f.gsa.gov/how-we-work/) with federal agency teams developing shared services within their own agencies. What we've seen in these engagements is that teams in the early stages of developing a centralized service often want to make design decisions that focus on customer needs; they want to build services that their agencies will use and value. However, they need extra help implementing the research and testing methods that help to surface the perspectives of their customers - during the conceptualization as well as along the way as the services get put in place. 

Shared services have been on the rise in government for close to a decade and The 2018 President's Management Agenda lists shared services as [a prioritized goal](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_5.html). We anticipate continued efforts to design shared services in government and, based on what we've seen through our consulting work, we anticipate a growing need for human centered design resources for these efforts. While 18F offers consulting services for those agencies seeking more hands on guidance, we want to also make sure that there are resources available for agencies that we never get a chance to work with directly. Our goal for this project is to develop human centered design resources tailored for shared services initiatives for the broader government community.

Funding for this project comes from [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov). We're currently in our second phase of funding. You can read more about the different phases of 10x funding [here](https://10x.gsa.gov/the-10x-process/).
