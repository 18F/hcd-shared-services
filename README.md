# Human Centered Design for Shared Services

## Project Description
Through this project, we will explore where the opportunities lie to establish human centered design practices in efforts to develop centralized administrative and IT services.  

### Why this project?
18F has handled numerous [path analysis engagments](https://18f.gsa.gov/how-we-work/) with federal agency teams tasked with developing shared services within their own agencies (also known as "intra-agency shared services"). What we've seen in these engagements is that it's common for there to be distance between those that decide upon shared service implementation and the intended users of those services. When we've been able to bridge that distance - by applying human centered design methods - we've been able to help our agency partners understand where these proposed services will bring value for their intended users. We've also been able to help them see where they are not yet set up for success - because centralizing IT functions can involve change that the agency might not be ready for. Unfortunately, many agencies that we have worked with have come to us only after having experienced first hand the burdens of having innovation projects not work out as expected. We have watched how human centered design can mitigate many of the risks that are inherent in starting a new service and we want to spread the practice in the context of intra-agency shared services.

Shared services have been on the rise in government for close to a decade and The 2018 President's Management Agenda lists shared services as [a prioritized goal](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_5.html). We anticipate growing efforts to design and implement shared services in government and we want to play a role in mitigating the risks that we've seen come from applying older methods of implementation that do not involve users in the process. While 18F offers consulting services for those agencies seeking more hands on guidance, we want to do what we can to also make resources available to those in government that we never get a chance to work with directly. 

Funding for this project comes from [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov). We're currently in our second phase of funding. You can read more about the different phases of 10x funding [here](https://10x.gsa.gov/the-10x-process/).
