## Week 4: understanding how others see shared services

### What we did:
- Refined our delivery timeline and our research plan;
- Held interviews;
- Focused on getting clear about what “shared services” actually are. Why are we doing that in week 4? Because many of the available definitions of "shared services" discuss desired outcomes from them but do not discuss their characteristics; since we are trying to evaluate the design approach to these services, we want to get clear about what the parameters are that govern the design possibilities.

- Reviewed material that USSM provides to agencies who are pursuing shared services, as well as an example RFQ to gather intelligence from service providers. We were interested in seeing the differences between pre-decision considerations around readiness and post-decision considerations around the best way to pursue and implement a service.

### What we learned:
A few things that we heard from our conversations with people who either were evangelists of shared services in government, or else were involved in IT service implementation:
- That it’s not often discussed what a “service” is; what providing a service means. Teams in government often think about the technological offering without discussing the business offering and responsibilities toward customers. And those conversations are important to surface; 
- That some types of organizations want more control over their tools than others;
- That government defines “shared services” based on outcomes rather than ingredients because the situations they’re deployed in are so variable;
- Folks across the spectrum told us that certain agencies and circumstances are more appropriate for shared services than others - that they won’t be a fit in every case. 

### What’s planned for next week
- Continue with interviews and synthesis;
- Studying 18F’s body of foundation engagements to see whether there are relevant learnings and contacts that we could treat as potential users of the resource that we produce (since often our partners in these engagements are teams that intend to implement a type of shared service);
- Outreach to potential users (and this might focus on agencies that don’t have the budget to hire 18F for an engagement and instead would only be able to rely on reading resources);
- Begin developing a journey map about the decision to pursue a shared service, so we can understand more about where the largest holes in our knowledge are;
- Brainstorm possible deliverables from this work, to help us identify possible directions to prototype, test, or pursue.
