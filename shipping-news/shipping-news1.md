This week we kicked off the second phase of a 10x funded project to develop HCD resources for teams developing shared services! :tada:

### What we did this week
- kick off meetings (internal, with 10x)
- started coordinating with the 10x government-wide user centered design support team (since we anticipate having overlap)
- created this github repo and set up our team infrastructure
- began researching existing shared services and human centered design playbooks
- began brainstorming to get specific about the problem that we're addressing 


### What we are planning for next week
- follow up with individuals that informed phase 1 work
- identify folks that we want to speak with (for user and stakeholder research)
- continue researching the design of digital playbooks and guidebooks that offer best practices for shared services implementation


Have a great weekend!
