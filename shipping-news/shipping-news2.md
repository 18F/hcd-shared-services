### What we did this week
- Connected with Lalitha and Anna who are working on developing user research resources;
- Researched existing shared services playbooks;
- Began outreach to pick up our conversations with the folks who informed phase 1 of this project;
- Brainstormed about different types of shared services in order to get clearer about the types of use cases we will want to highlight; which use cases need HCD resources the most;
- Spoke with a contact at the Federal CIO Council;
- Reviewed the President’s Management Agenda’s shared services priority statement.

### What we learned and brainstormed about
- Broad digital services playbooks do not provide high-fidelity insights to delivering shared services. We learned far more from reviewing shared services playbooks and thinking about what lessons apply to federal teams;
- We’re wondering whether the shared services playbooks that we looked at are known about and used by the teams that they target;
- We’re wondering what parts of the existing resources are helpful in a practical way, and where there there’s need for resources that we might be able to fill;
- We began to flesh out the different benefits that shared services might offer: (1) cost savings? (2) more efficient practices? (3) better citizen services? (4) standardization? 
- We began thinking about different ways that shared services come into place: top down? Bottom up?
- We began thinking about the distinctions between shared tools and standardization (ie, shared processes)

### What we are planning for next week
- We’ll schedule more conversations: (1) to follow up with folks who informed phase one, (2) to capture CIO perspectives about the benefits and pain points related to shared services; (3) to see what more we can learn about whether shared services tend to, in fact, reduce costs - because there are debates about this.
- Continue research around the friction/pain points around shared services
- Brainstorm and see where we go from there; we’re still in early stages.


### Something to consider
Since we are nearing the end of FY18, and 18F projects with expiring funds need to get staffed, and this project’s funding will not expire, we might put this project on hold until October in order to work on these projects. We’ll be clearer about his next week.
