### What we did this week
- held team brainstorming sessions to talk about defining shared services, since the definitions that are out there aren't so clear
- identified substantive areas that we want to learn more about and began identifying who we'd want to speak with to learn more about these areas:
  - how shared services come to be
  - how users understand and feel about shared services
  - where initiatives for centralized admin/IT in agencies have been successful/failed
  - what are the prominent circumstances under which centralization typically happens (data center consolidation? cloud migration? What else? Is there one that is particularly important?
  
- scheduled some upcoming conversations
- began learning about the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity & Efficiency (CIGIE) and their views about benefits/risks of shared services

### What we learned / began thinking about
- shared services are often written about in terms of the outcomes that they produce, rather than what they actually are operationally. We want to be clear about the characteristics of the shared services that we choose to focus becuase doing so will allow us to talk about design - of the _thing_ not the _outcome_   
- we began thinking about the potential connections between shared services implementation and [FITARA](https://management.cio.gov/) and how HCD for shared services might support compliance with FITARA 
- related to FITARA, we're wondering how often shared services initiatives go hand in hand with data center consolidations


### What we are planning for next week
- hold some interviews, including one follow conversation with contacts at USSM. They have already produced materials to help agencies transition to shared services [(M3)](https://www.ussm.gov/m3/) and are enthusiastic about incorporating HCD into it 
- do a retro and close down for the project since we'll be putting it on hold until the beginning of FY19 (this is so that James and I can work on FY18 projects that need to get staffed)
